    "Many cephalopods have a special kind of color-changing cells that enable them to manipulate their appearance and blend in with their surroundings.",
"Octopuses do not have tentacles, they have eight arms. Cuttlefish have eight arms and two tentacles. https://aqua.org/blog/2017/October/Cephalopods-Arms-or-Tentacles ",
"Smaller male Australian giant cuttlefish (who would never win over females with their physical prowess) have been known to use their chromatophores to change their appearance and pass themselves off as female, enabling them get close enough to the females to mate. https://www.uw360.asia/mating-season-the-australian-giant-cuttlefish/ ",
"When threatened, cuttlefish can produce a cloud of an ink known as sepia, to protect themselves from predators. This ink was historically used in writing and drawing, and is where we get the name of the  color sepia.",
"Hawaiian bobtail squid have a unique, symbiotic relationship with bioluminescent bacteria that makes its home in a special organ, known as the “light organ” in the squid’s mantle. The bacteria provide camouflage by mimicking the starlight hitting the top of the squid, making them invisible from below. The squid, in turn, provide food for the bacteria.",
"US Air Force materials scientists have studied the relationship between hawaiian bobtail squid and their bioluminescent bacteria in an effort to develop better camouflages for their aircraft.",
"Sand tiger shark pups fight to the death in utero. Scientists believe that this is a way males ensure paternity, as sharks can carry litters with multiple fathers.",
"The mako shark is the fastest shark in the world - reaching bursts of 72 km/h (45mph)",
"Greenland are one of the oldest vertebrate species. Radiocarbon dating has been used to estimate the age of deceased greenland sharks to be over 500 years.",
"Many shark and ray species have been known to abort their pups when they are captured, likely to give their pups a chance at survival when the mother is in danger. This presents further risk to already threatened shark populations.",
"Some sharks are viviparous (meaning they bear live young) while some are oviparous ( they lay eggs) but the majority of shark species are ovoviviparous, meaning fertilized eggs hatch inside the womb before the mother gives birth to live young. ",
"Port Jackson sharks are oviparous, and lay a spiral-shaped egg case.",
"The whale shark is the largest fish measuring up to 12.2 meters (40 feet) and weighing up to 40 tons. ",
"Sharks have special organs called ampullae of Lorenzini that enable them to sense electric fields and changes in temperature, which allows them to find prey that would otherwise remain hidden. ",
"Scalloped hammerhead sharks swim in schools of several hundred - which is highly unusual for predators. Unfortunately, this makes them easy prey for fishermen looking to profit from large catches.",
"White sharks return to their home waters to give birth, which results in genetically isolated white shark populations, despite the fact that sharks can traverse 2,000 miles without stopping.",
"White sharks store energy in their livers, which they can draw from in the winter and during migration.",
"Sharks, rays, skates, and sawfish don’t have bones, but have cartilaginous skeletons. ",
"Tapetum is a reflective tissue found in the back of a shark’s eyeball that enable them to see well even in very low light.",
"Shark skin is made up of tiny overlapping teeth-like structures, which reduce drag when swimming, and give the skin a sandpaper-like feel.",
"Whale sharks have unique spot patterns, like fingerprints.",
"Blue whales calves drink 100 gallons of milk a day, gaining 9lbs an hour. ",
"Dolphins rest half their brains at a time, which enables them to keep breathing while they sleep. ",

"Mantis shrimp have 12 different types of photoreceptors, and can see light on the wavelengths to 300-720nm, which spans from the infrared to ultraviolet spectrum, far beyond what we can see as humans.",
"Green sea turtles are able to drink salt water because they have a salt gland near each eye that enables them to expel excess salt, also making it appear as if they are crying.",
"Green sea turtles have beaks instead of teeth.",
"The sea wasp, a member of the box jellyfish class Cubozoa, has enough venom to kill up to 60 adult humans.",
"Humans have only explored about 5% of the world’s oceans.",
"As much as 80% of the oxygen in our environment comes from phytoplankton found in the ocean.",
"Cold water corals don’t grow in reefs like their tropical counterparts.",
"Hydrothermal vents create the only known ecosystem that runs on chemical energy, and not solar energy.",
"Coral reefs are incredibly sensitive to variation in temperature and grow best between temperatures of 21-29C, or 70-85F.",
"Massive coral species are among the slowest growing species, growing at a rate of 5-25mm per year.",
"The Great Barrier Reef covers over 133,000 square miles, or 344,400 square kilometers, and is home to over 1500 species."
